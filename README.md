# SEP11 Freedom Project
by Hanna

## Context
The "Freedom Project" for SEP11 is all about creating a product using JavaScript with the tool of your choice. The purpose of this blog is to jounral my process of creating my product, learning my tool, documenting my challenges, how I overcome my challenges and my takeaways.

## Content
For my project, my group and I made a pet finder web app to help people find their lost pets through connection with other people. This blog will walk through my process of independently studying my tool Firebase in order to make the authenication and chat page for the user to save their detail on their account and communicate with other users on the webapp during realtime.

## Implications

The Petfinder web app has positive and negative impacts on the future. On a positive note, the web app can create communities where people come together to assist each other in finding their lost pets. Pet owners can rely on this web app to reunite with their missing pets, and over time, the web app will become the first place people go when their pet goes missing. When people can find their lost pets through the internet, this decreases the overcrowding in animal shelters, which also reduces the need for resources and space in the shelters, which can be limited. This promotes responsible pet ownership, reduces the number of stray animals as users can chat about animals that they find, and increases awareness about animal welfare. Eventually, more jobs to support the web app will be created, such as teams to help locate missing pets and people maintaining and updating the web app. To bolster the use of the pet finder, an additional option should be added so people can invest in and fund the web app. On a negative note, the app may not always have up-to-date information, leading to false hope or disappointment. When a pet is found, it could take time for records to be updated, and this can be a frustrating and emotional experience for pet owners who are worried about their missing pet. There's a possibility of scams or fake listings, which could lead to people losing money, being scammed, or worse, being put into dangerous situations. Lastly, people without access to the internet may not be able to use the Petfinder web app. But there are always pet shelters that are open to help!
