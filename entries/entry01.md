## Locking in Tool
----

### <b>Plan</b>
After considering between [Google Script App](https://www.google.com/script/start/) or [Firebase](https://console.firebase.google.com/), I have decided on Firebase as it's a good tool used to store user data with security and that's exactly what I want with my budget plan web idea. With firebase's storage, I can integrate it's system in my html webpage using `npm install ~y` and import config. Then using its documentation storage page with this [guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IFRVMEhZDc) set up a updating data collection, also remembering to add security with the security rule documentation. <br>
### My storage Page should include:
* Dated spendings
* A goal per month available to be spent
* How much the user earns a month
* Compare the earnings - spent
* An average of how much is spent a year
* Comparison of each months spending
* Similar to a spread sheet but with more elements

### Extra:
* Customize coloring for the web
* Graphs for data
*
### <b> Before That</b>
Before creating my freedom project, I would need some practice with firebase to be confident and successful during the process so as through trials and failures, I been playing around with setting an authentication for google logins. I learned that in firebase, there's a lot of enables and disable needed to be done because I missed a step which was to enable my google logins when I wrote out a short script for getting a sign in button to work and hide the password the page won't load. So, I repeated my process and saw that missed step. It's very useful with a [videos](https://fireship.io/lessons/the-ultimate-beginners-guide-to-firebase/) to follow along!

### <b> Engineering Design Process 1</b>
The problem is that I seem to always be short on cash and wondering why when I don't think I go out much or buy items. But then I realized I do and end up forgeting so I have no track of where my money has gone. I know a budget tracking is useful which I tried with paper but it's just not sustainable. However, a web app would solve this problem of mine, plus save me money from buying more supply to write with.

### <b> Skill</b>
To learn more about my tool, I been using the skill of <i> how to google </i> using like key words 'firebase' and 'js'. Accessing to but not limiting to one source: the official web for firebase but also use firebship, freecodecamp, the youtube, and reddit. This year, I been really feeling the pressure of having much more responsibilities than sophomore year and I notice my <i> Time management </i> skills improve, especially now that I use google calendar and a checklist for my responsibilities which is exactly why I believe a budget plan would make my life a lot easier. Lastly, a <i> Growth Mindset </i> as I get older I learn how important having the right mindset is to grow, we all shouldn't be limited to what we think we are capable of accomplishing but push ourselves to learn more with openness. I put this into practice by setting a new challenge every year and not get upset over my failures but to learn from. Failures are my way to success. The scarist part is not trying.
